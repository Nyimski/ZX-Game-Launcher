  0. Definitions.
    This License refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  1. Applicability of This License.
    This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
    under the terms of this License. The "Program", below, refers to any
    such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either
    the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say,
    a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or
    with modifications.

  2. Verbatim copying of the Program.
    You may copy, distribute, and modify the Program under the terms of
    this License, provided that you keep intact all copyright notices,
    disclaimers of warranty, and the terms of this License. You may
    distribute copies of the Program under the terms of this License, and
    you may charge a fee for the distribution of copies.

  3. Modifications to the Program.
    You may modify the Program or any part of it, provided that the
    modifications are marked and documented. You may distribute copies
    of the Program, including your modifications, under the terms of this
    License, as long as you retain the copyright notices of the original
    work and include appropriate notices of your changes.

  4. Patents.
    If you convey a copy of the Program or a work based on the Program,
    you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise
    of the rights granted by this License. You may not use the Program in
    any way that infringes the rights of others under patent law.

  5. No warranty.
    The Program is distributed with the hope that it will be useful, but
    WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

  6. Termination.
    If you violate the terms of this License, your rights under it are
    automatically terminated. However, if you stop violating the terms and
    correct your violation within 30 days, your rights will be restored.

  7. Distribution of source code.
    You must provide access to the source code of the Program, either by
    including it in the distribution or providing a written offer to provide
    it.

  8. License Compatibility.
    If you modify the Program and distribute your modifications, you must
    license the modified program under the same GPLv3 terms. You must also
    provide access to the modified source code.

  9. Acceptance.
    By using, modifying, or distributing the Program, you accept the terms
    of this License.

  10. Further information.
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with the Program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
